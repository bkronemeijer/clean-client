# Dustly client

### Introduction
This is the client repository of the Dustly project. It is still an MVP, more feature will be implemented in a later stage. The idea of Dustly is to help (student) households to set up and maintain a cleaning schedule. The goals of this project are to practice with full-stack javascript development, and to learn how to use Typescript. The backend repository can be found on https://github.com/bkronemeijer/clean-server .
